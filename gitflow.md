What is Git Flow?
-------------------
Git flow is a branching model usedd in Git and is well suited to collaboration and scaling for the develompent team. Its key benefits include parralel develompent, collaboration, release staging area and support for emergency fixes. For parralel develompent, GitHub makes it very easy by isolating new develompent from finished work. New develompent is done in something called feature branchs. Collaboraton is when developers use feature branches to collaborate the the same feature. Once new develompent is completed it merges back into the develop branch which is a staging area for completed features that have not beem released. GitFlow also supports hotfix branches which are branches made from a tagged release.
